## Abstract

Immutables are great! You can pass them around without worries, have multiple threads use them concurrently, and you never need to copy them.

But your program state changes the whole time. In the past, most program state was modeled using mutable data structures. But now we’re realizing that we can make most of the state immutable, and only modify the parts that need modification.

During this presentation, Reinier and Roel will take you through the current state-of-the-art standard java features and libraries, and discuss the latest ideas for the future of java, as gathered from blog posts, presentations by core committers and public jdk mailing lists.

And they wouldn’t be core Lombok developers if they wouldn’t point out what features they already built to help developers create immutable data structures in an ever changing world.

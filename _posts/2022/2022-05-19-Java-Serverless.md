### Zusammenfassung

Java hast been one of the most popular programming languages for many years, but it used to have hard times in the serverless community. Java is known for its high cold start times and high memory footprint. For both, you have to pay to the cloud providers of your choice. That’s why most developers tried to avoid using Java for such use cases. But times change: Community and cloud providers steadily improve things for Java developers. In this talk, we look at the features and possibilities the AWS cloud provider offers for Java developers and look the most popular Java frameworks, like Micronaut, Quarkus and Spring (Boot) and look how (AOT compiler and GraalVM native images play a huge role) they address serverless challenges and enable Java for broad usage in the serverless world.

Der Vortrag wird auf Deutsch sein. __Vielen Dank an Vadym__ für das kurzfristige Einspringen.
